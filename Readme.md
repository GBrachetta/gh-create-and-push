# Ghcreate

`Ghcreate` is a command line tool that initializes a repository, adds a `.gitignore` file, creates a GitHub repository with a chosen name and description, adds the remote origin and pushes the local repository to the remote.

You can install it with `node i -g @GBrachetta/ghcreate` and run it from your terminal with `ghcreate`.
